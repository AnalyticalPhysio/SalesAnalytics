Sales and Financial Analytics using Advance Excel

This is a Sales and Financial Analytics in which I enabled AtliQ Hardware to oversee and assess its sales operations and performance. Along with that I also assessed the financial performance, aiding decision-making, and enhancing stakeholder communication.
